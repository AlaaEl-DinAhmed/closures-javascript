/*
Closure from MDN

A closure is the combination of a function bundled together (enclosed)
with references to its surrounding state (the lexical environment).
In other words, a closure gives you access to an outer functionâ€™s scope
from an inner function. In JavaScript, closures are created every time
a function is created, at function creation time.

/*
Closure from my point of view 

However outer function is executed and inner function is defined within
that scope, inner function is able to hold on to the reference of
outer scope (outer function), and whatever you pass to the
function (outer function), it continues to have access to it.
inner function have a linkage to the outer scope or whatever
a variable is defined in it.

function outer(x) {
    function inner() {
        console.log(x)

    inner()
}
